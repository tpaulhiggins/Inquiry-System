# Inquiry-System version 0.1 
Creating an inquiry system for Karina (Sozo event manager) for event management.  

idea:
This web-based application will ask a user a set of specific questions upfront. These questions should be geared towards making Karina Martinez's life easier when dealing with customers. This means trying to automate this process as much as possible the first time. 

GOAL: we want to try and mitigate the amount of emails sent to the customer in the background A.K.A outside the system. 

Process should go like this:
1) User should be presented with all necessary questions. Those questions are as follows: 
   First Name
   Last Name
   Event Type (We are trying to deny certain events, which is why this is one of the things needing approval)
   Date of Event (Needs to be checked against calendar with approved events)
   Description (Anything extra customer needs such as extra chairs, couches, tables, sound system, drinks, ect.)
   
2) Event information sent to Karina in an email about everything user has filled out through form. 
3) Karina should approve the event and book it.
